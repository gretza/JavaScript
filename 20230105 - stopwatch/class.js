/*
    Create a class named "JobWorker" which accepts a name argument in its constructor.
    If a name argument is not provided, use a default value "unnamed"

    The class has two attributes:
    - name (string, from the constructor)
    - accumulatedCost (number, starts at 0)

    The class has two methods:
    - doJob(): logs to the console the following string `${name} has done a job!`,
        and increments the accumulated cost by 500.

    - payWorker(): logs to the console the following string `${name} has been paid ${accumulatedCost}`,
        and then the accumulated cost is reset to 0.
*/
